On Halloween in 2020, Matt Parker, the creator of the YouTube Channel *Standup Maths*, posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nogAYHmnNw) about, what he was calling, *Vampire Matrices*. In this early definition of the term, a (single) Vampire Matrix was a square matrix consisting of positive integers such that the square of the matrix was equal to its element-wise concatenation.
