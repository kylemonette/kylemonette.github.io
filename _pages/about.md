I am a PhD student in applied mathematics at the [University of Rhode Island](https://www.math.uri.edu). My interests include numerical linear algebra, Krylov subspace methods, and some other bits and pieces from other areas. 

I am native to western Massachusetts and received my Bachelor's of Science degree in mathematics from [Clarkson University](https://www.clarkson.edu/academics/arts-sciences/mathematics) in Potsdam, NY with the class of 2022, and my Master's of Science in mathematics from URI in 2024.
