I am a master's student (soon to be PhD student) in mathematics at the [University of Rhode Island](https://www.math.uri.edu). My interests include linear algebra and analysis. 

I am native to western Massachusetts and received my Bachelor's of Science degree in mathematics from [Clarkson University](https://www.clarkson.edu/academics/arts-sciences/mathematics) in Potsdam, NY with the class of 2022.
