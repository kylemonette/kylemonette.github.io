## Interests

I am interested in topics in linear algebra and my current work deals specifically with the GMRES algorithm (a Krylov projection method for solving linear systems).

## Project: Vampire Matrices

Recently I have been exploring a special type of matrices sometimes called <i>vampire matrices</i>, which became popular from Matt Parker's [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nogAYHmnNw) in 2020. The original vampire matrix is a square matrix $A$, usually $2 \times 2$ or $3\times 3$, with integer entries between $1$ and $9$ such that $A^2=11A$. I have worked on generalizing such matrices to include $d$ digit numbers and to include more terms in the matrix equation. A brief overview is given in a recent [conference presentation](/files/mccnny-2024.pdf) in March 2024.
