## Interests

I am interested in topics in matrix theory, in particular the intersection with spectral theory and functional analysis. 

## Project: Vampire Matrices

Recently I have been exploring a special type of square matrices called <i>vampire matrices</i>, which became popular from Matt Parker's [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nogAYHmnNw) in 2020. The original vampire matrix is a square matrix $A$ with integer entries (usually between $1$ and $9$) such that $A^2=11A$. I successfully classified and found Vampire Matrices of size 2, 3, and 4. Currently I am doing the same for other types of vampire matrices, including forms such as $AB=10A+B$.
